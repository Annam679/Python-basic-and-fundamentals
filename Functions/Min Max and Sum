#Write a program that receives a sequence of numbers (integers) separated by a single space. It should print the min
#and max values of the given numbers and the sum of all the numbers in the list. Use min(), max() and sum().
#The output should be as follows:
#• On the first line: "The minimum number is {minimum number}"
#• On the second line: "The maximum number is {maximum number}"
#• On the third line: "The sum number is: {sum of all numbers}
