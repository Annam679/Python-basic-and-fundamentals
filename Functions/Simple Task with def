#Write a function that calculates the total price of an order and returns it. The function should receive one of the following products:
# "coffee", "coke", "water", or "snacks", and a quantity of the product. The prices for a single piece of each product are:
#• coffee - 1.50
#• water - 1.00
#• coke - 1.40
#• snacks - 2.00
#Print the result formatted to the second decimal place.
