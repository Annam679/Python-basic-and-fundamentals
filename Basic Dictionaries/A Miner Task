#You will be given a sequence of strings, each on a new line until you receive the "stop" command. Every odd line
#on the console represents a resource (e.g., Gold, Silver, Copper, and so on) and every even - quantity. Your task is to
#collect the resources and print them each on a new line.
#Print the resources and their quantities in the following format:
#"{resource} -> {quantity}"
#The quantities will be in the range [1 â€¦ 2 000 000 000].
#Input:                    Output:
#Gold                      Gold -> 155
#155                       Silver -> 10
#Silver                    Copper -> 17
#10
#Copper
#17
#stop
