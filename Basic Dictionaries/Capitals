#Using a dictionary comprehension, write a program that receives country names on the first line, separated by
#comma and space ", ", and their corresponding capital cities on the second line (again separated by comma and
#space ", "). Print each country with their capital on a separate line in the following format: "{country} ->
#{capital}".

countries = input().split(", ")
cities = input().split(", ")

dictionary = {countries[index]:cities[index]  for index in range(len(countries))}
# dictionary = dict(zip(countries, cities))
for country, capital in dictionary.items():
    print(f'{country} -> {capital}')
