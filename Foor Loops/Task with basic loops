Write a program which read the number of open browsers, the salary and afterward it read the name of the websites opened
in these browsers. If the salary is completely cut write 'You have lost your salary.'. Otherwise, write how much money is left.

n_tabs = int(input())
salary = int(input())

for tab in range(n_tabs):
    current_website = input()
    if current_website == 'Facebook':
        salary -= 150
    elif current_website == 'Instagram':
        salary -= 100
    elif current_website == 'Reddit':
        salary -= 50

    if salary <= 0:
        print(f'You have lost your salary.')
        break

if salary > 0:
    print(salary)
